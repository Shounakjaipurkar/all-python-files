# If ... Else in One Line
# There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be 
# used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short. 
# Here's an example:


a=330
b=330
print("a is greater than b")if a>b else print("b is greater than a")if a<b else print("a is equal to b") 


c = 2
d = 330
print("A") if c > d else print("D")


x=int(input("Enter the first number: "))
y=int(input("Enter the seconde number: "))
result=400 if x>y else 230
print(result)
