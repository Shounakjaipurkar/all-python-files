# Python docstrings are the string 
# right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module.
# As mentioned above, Python docstrings are strings used right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module (like in Example 1). 
# They are used to document our code.
# We can access these docstrings using the doc attribute.

# Python doc attribute
# Whenever string literals are present just after the definition of a function, module, class or method, 
#  are associated with the object as their doc attribute.
#  We can later use this attribute to retrieve this docstring.
def square(n):
  '''Takes in a number n, returns the square of n'''
  print(n**2)
square(5)
# print(square.__doc__)
print(square.__doc__)


'''PEP 8
PEP 8 is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. 
It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan.
 The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.

PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.
