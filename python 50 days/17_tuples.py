# Python Tuples
# Tuples are ordered collection of data items. They store multiple items in a single variable. 
# Tuple items are separated by commas and enclosed within round brackets (). 
# Tuples are unchangeable meaning we can not alter them after creation.

# # Example 1:

# tuple1 = (1,2,2,3,5,4,6)
# tuple2 = ("Red", "Green", "Blue")
# print(tuple1)
# print(tuple2)
# # Output:

# # (1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6)
# ('Red', 'Green', 'Blue')
# Example 2:

# details = ("Abhijeet", 18, "FYBScIT", 9.8)
# print(details)
# # Output:
# # ('Abhijeet', 18, 'FYBScIT', 9.8)


num=(1,2,3,4,5,6)
print(num)
print(type(num),"this is the tuple")
print(num[-3]) 
# 6-3=4
